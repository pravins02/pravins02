- 👋 Hi, I’m Pravin Sharma and I am a 3rd year PhD candidate in the [Department of Applied Science](https://wm.edu/as/appliedscience), [William & Mary](https://wm.edu). I work in field of Ultrafast Magnetization dynamics with Prof. Gunter Luepke in The Optics and Laser Lab.  
- 👀 I’m interested in understanding the interfacial spin dynamics of different magnetic materials and their heterostructures.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to do the Atomistic Spin Dynamics Simulations using different tools and how it can be used in my PhD research.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on creating new materials for data storage devices.
- 📫 You can reach me via email.
- 😄 Pronouns: he/him/his
- ⚡ Fun fact: I like playing outdoor games.
